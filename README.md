## RTBM Text Box Class


</div>

### Description

Sick and tired of the not very useful Microsoft Text Box Control? Fear no more. With thic class module, you can allow the text box control to perform much more functionality.

For instance - Word automation is now possible, for example.

I plan to make an Active-X control in the future.

### More Info
 
Attention New Users:

This code is quite advanced, because it deals with class modules. You need a good understanding of class modules to understand this code. Feel free to have a look at the code, anyway.

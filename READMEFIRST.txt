Please note that after you have added the class module to your
project, in whichever forms you wish to use the class module,
right at the top of the form, declare this line of code:

Dim rtbmtextbox as new rtbmtextbox

This will make the class functions, subs and properties readily
available. 

Also, extra controls might be needed for some functions to work
properly. 

Basically, the rtbmtextbox class is a class that I developed 
so I could create a brand new text box class with extra
functions and some properties... let me know what you think. 

Have fun and please leave comments and a vote,
